---------
* From [Boardwalk](https://github.com/zhuowei/Boardwalk)'s ashes here comes PojavLauncher!

* PojavLauncher is a launcher that allows you to play Minecraft:Java Edition on your Android device!

* It can run almost every version of the Minecraft, allowing you to use .jar only installers to install modloaders like [forge](https://files.minecraftforge.net/), [fabric](http://fabricmc.net/), [optifine](https://optifine.net); hack clients like LabyMod and much more!

* For more details [check out our wiki](https://github.com/PojavLauncherTeam/PojavLauncher/wiki)
## Some notes to start with
- We do not exist on TikTok. No one from the dev team makes TikTok videos. 
- The official Twitter for PojavLauncher is [@PLaunchTeam](https://twitter.com/PLaunchTeam). Any others (most notably @PojavLauncher) are fake, please report them to Twitter's moderation team.

<p>
This is a community fork. Any features introduced in later launcher versions will not be added unless done so.
</p>

<p>
Expected dumb experiments:</p>

* Changelog Page powered by VuePress
* Zink returns; no VirGL
* offline mode?
* dumb ui revamp
* fuck up everything i guess
